The aim of the paper is to explain workflows, methodologies, meanings of the 'MedAniene Project', realised through the collaborative use of Wikipedia by the association ArcheoFOSS.
Wikipedia is the largest open collaborative encyclopaedia online, the place on the web where anyone can create and improve contents. Wikipedia.org is among the top ten most viewed websites in the world.
The creation of Wikipedia pages dedicated to cultural, natural, and historical places gives the readers the opportunity to learn more about their cultural heritage and identity in an open and digital way.
Using Wiki pages, it is possible to analyse data about views, accesses, and clicks on shared content, to evaluate the impact of specific activities in terms of audience reach and their engagement.
Publishing cultural contents on Wikipedia can offer additional benefits and expand the local museums visibility.
Texts, images, data added on Wikipedia pages can in fact be re-used, quoted, and linked by third parties under the CC BY-SA 3.0 licence. It means that these contents can be shared by third parties i.e local guides or other online media, both inside and outside the Wiki world, citing the source.
Generallyin Italy the local museums  lack online published scientific information and effective digital communication strategies. 
The “MedAniene project”, presented in this paper, involves the creation or the editing of Wikipedia pages of the Aniene Valley’s museums located near Rome.
The museums involved by the project are the "Museo Villa Garibaldi" in Riofreddo, the "Museo delle Tradizioni Musicali" in Arsoli, the "Museo della Civiltà Contadina Valle dell’Aniene” in Roviano, the "Museo Civico di Arte Moderna e Contemporanea” in Anticoli Corrado, the “Museo delle attività cartarie e della stampa” in the “Rocca Abbaziale” of Subiaco, the "Museo Civico Archeologico Villa di Traiano” in Arcinazzo, and the "Museo Demoetnoantropologico Castrum Vivarii" in Vivaro Romano.
The aim of the work is to improve communication and increase the visibility of these museums by providing the public with scientific information in open access mode.
By visiting their Wiki page, the reader can get a glimpse of the findings and collections exhibited, ideally to get interested in visiting the venue.
In a virtuous cycle, more visitors should also prompt the museums themselves to provide more digital contents (texts, images, and bibliography).
The directors of the aforementioned museums actively collaborated on the project, providing us with the material needed for publishing the Wiki pages, revising content, and allowing the publication of materials and photos under a CC BY-SA 3.0 licence.
In conclusion, this work created a digital, open, and collaborative space of communication improving the connection between these museums and their territories.
