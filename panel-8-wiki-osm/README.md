## Panel presentation

Using digital technologies, cultural institutions wised up themselves as gateways to their territories, to share their history and promote their social context. The lack of a common method marginalises the efforts of individual institutions to develop digital projects, they often lack the necessary resources to engage in a wide range of cultural transformation processes as required in the 21st century. However, the deployment in the cultural institutions of FLOS methods, technologies and public open data portal proved to be successful in solving the challenges of our times by constantly involving the local communities (Rosati 2021). One of the most important issue recognised, Wikidata collects all data from Wikimedia projects, is among the largest open databases and one of the most powerful tools to overcome the challenges of the digital transformation (Hinnosaar et al. 2017). 

Using Wikidata, it is possible to process SPARQL queries (Edelstein et al. 2013) of one of the largest knowledge graphs on the web. By way of example, two cases are below mentioned:

- the census of all Italian cultural heritage (in joint operation with the General Catalogue of Cultural Heritage of the MIC) and related to the WikiLovesMonuments competition (Malatesta, Milella 2013);
- the creation in France of semantic museum catalogues (Albore et al. 2021) that will soon be available for other Italian institutions.

Wikidata represents a virtuous model of a bottom-up approach, which is expected to grow along with the political awareness of communities: there is an urgent need to develop a "strategic" awareness on the re-use and impact of open data.

The panel will therefore focus on presenting collaborative projects, starting from academic or territorial communities, volunteers or associations, which have used wiki tools or the OpenStreetMap platform to generate an institutional, cultural, territorial impact.
