**Proposal text**
A concluding panel workshop is presented in this session. The three authors will manage an edithaton+mapathon+edit/datathon event in one of the museums of the Sapienza Museum System.
The workshop led by the three authors will take 4 hours. The activity will be conducted in collaboration with Wikimedia Italia and will lead participants to practice their skills in collaborative projects and the open philosophy.
The aim is to disseminate to a wide audience of young students and researchers the techniques used every day by those working in the opening up of knowledge through Wiki tools.
Learning by opening up knowledge to others, means learning twice. The workshop organisers, together with members of the ArchaeoFOSS APS and Wikimedia, will divide the class in three interest groups. The groups will be trained on the workflows and the significance of the actions performed. 
They will proceed inside the chosen museum structure, collecting photographs, information, contacts, and edited material on the masterpieces in the museum. 
Finally, everything will be transferred to a Wiki page created specifically for the event, inserting the right tags, metadata, rights, routes, points of interest and RDF triplets. 
The event will be useful to make part of the museum heritage of the Sapienza University of Rome accessible to all.
