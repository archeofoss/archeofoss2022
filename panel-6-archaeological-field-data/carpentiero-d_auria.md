BIM, acronym for Building Information Modelling, is one of the most consolidated work methods for the engineering design of buildings and infrastructural works. BIM allows you to create a comprehensive database starting from the 3D model of a building. This system represents an all-encompassing data platform where all the information related to the built work can be used like a basis for planning any management, maintenance and enhancement. 3D modelling is done through parametric objects, 3D re-presentation of all those elements - structural, plant engineering and decorative - that make up a building. Each object must be correlated with records of different nature (geometric, structural, etc.). The use of BIM for archaeology allows to test and transform a working method born for engineering design, in a valid operational support for the archaeologist during the field phase and after, in the data processing phase. By using Autodesk Revit software, it is possible to recreate the reality of the archaeological building by means of parametric BIM objects. The interaction between records related to them does get a searchable database, accessible to all professionals working on the building. An ideal case study to test the potential of BIM, as a model for managing an archaeological context, is represented by Pompeii. The extraordinary state of conservation of the ancient Vesuvian town and the wide variety of architectural types it offers, constitute an essential reference point for any research concerning Roman architecture of the republican and early-imperial periods. This is truth also when one means to assess the utility of using BIM information systems for the management of all types of documents (texts, photographs, drawings, 3D re-constructions) related to an ancient building and concerning both its study and conservation. The Pompeian context therefore represents a suitable field of experimentation, to evaluate how to turn a BIM information system into an efficient tool to support archaeological research, especially in the phases of data organization and interpretation. This aim can be reached by creating a semantic library model, exportable and including a range of parametric objects so wide and varied as to correspond to the set of elements that potentially could be part of the 3D BIM model of a Roman building. For this purpose, libraries of archaeological parametric objects modelled ad hoc on Pompeian buildings have been created. The structural features of the main Pompeian building techniques have been recreated in BIM (material, internal stratigraphy, etc.). These objects, completed of structural and compositional parameters, texturized on a real basis and completed of custom graphics, represent a support for sharing and using on a large scale the representation in BIM of a large portion of records pertaining to a same phase of the building. Each element can be then exported in IFC format, downloaded and used on any BIM environment software.
