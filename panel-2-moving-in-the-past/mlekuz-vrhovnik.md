With the increased availability of country-wide lidar datasets, a new
source to explore past mobility patterns can be employed.

In the presentation, I explore the potential of lidar datasets in
detecting large-scale mobility patterns across landscapes.   Lidar
reveals landscapes previously hidden below a woodland canopy in
fantastic clarity. One of the most ubiquitous features of the woodland
floor is holloways or sunken lanes. I want to explore the potential of
large-scale holloway data for the study of past mobility.

In Europe, but also in the Near East, with millennia-old inhabited
landscapes that highlight long-term relations between humans, domestic
animals and landscapes, holloways are ubiquitous landscape features.
They form wide interleaved corridors of paths running on the ridges
and avoiding boggy valley floors. They represent traces of long-term
human and animal movement as they walk across the landscape.

This movement is not just about individual journeys but about
long-term patterns that emerge from routinised travel. These spacetime
patterns, especially when viewed over extensive time frames, can be
described as flows.

These flows move people, animals, things and substances into new
positional and relational contexts with other things and create new
material encounters, allowing different flows to emerge.

In this way, the large-scale holloway data derived from lidar datasets
can be seen as traces of the past landscape-scale activity systems,
stable, multi-scale spatio-temporal patterns formed from intertwined
allocation of time among practices in space.

It is interesting to explore such patterns as the situated topologies,
which enable and frame performances in a landscape. Movement is a way
of orienting in the world and, thus, particular forms of movement have
different impacts.

THose patterns enable the study of morphogenesis of complex flow
patterns.   Studying these patterns is crucial to future mobilities
research as it intersects with scientific research into dynamical
systems. It also suggests that when we study landscape and movement,
we need to move beyond predefined, planned network topologies and
consider fluid, surprising, emergent forms of large-scale movement.
