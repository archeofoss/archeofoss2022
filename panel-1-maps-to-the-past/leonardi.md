Among the activities of emergence, cataloging and enhancement in place for the
organization of geographical knowledge, a geoweb storage mapping was created to which
various functions are attributed, from those of local archiving to those of dissemination and
global consultation. It is a dynamic archive with geographic-historical paths in relation to the
contents drawn up over time and present in the database of negative glass plates and
cartography kept in the Library of the Department of Literature and Modern Cultures in its
Geography section. The architecture of the entire system was developed at the
GeoCartographic Laboratory and the initial idea of building a simple data archive replaces
the more ambitious one of assembling an online system for the dynamic management of a
database of images and textual contents (data on the location, geographical area, toponym,
image description, real or inferred coordinates, etc.). Among the reasons that led to opt for
such a structured portal is that of being part of an ad hoc assembled whole, easily
manageable and reproducible by cloning, therefore, from the hardware / software point of
view (virtual machines servers), a system capable of satisfying not only simple archiving but
also spatial research based on geolocation. The project will depart from the theoretical
approach of cultural geography as an end in itself, to focus on new ways that allow the
dissemination of a geography based on new digital interfaces through the activation of
connection networks that have archives in common with important geo-historical documents.
